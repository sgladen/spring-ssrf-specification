# README

This repository is part of my master thesis.
I created a small example of an SSRF-vulnerable web application, which I needed for the proof of concept.

The main project is [spring-ssrf](https://github.com/sgladen/spring-ssrf).

This repo contains only the specifications for [secucheck](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/secucheck).
We used branch `SC-1.2.0`.

The configuration file for secucheck is [secucheck.yml](/secucheck.yml).
Adjust it for your system.
